### OpenWRT for M3
This is an openwrt fork for the UCSD M3 project (http://m3.ucsd.edu/sdr/). M3 is the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio platform. 

### Supported Devices
[Mikrotik wAP 60G](https://mikrotik.com/product/wap_60g#fndtn-specifications)

[Mikrotik wAP 60G AP](https://mikrotik.com/product/wap_60g_ap#fndtn-specifications)

[Mikrotik wAP 60Gx3 AP](https://mikrotik.com/product/wap_60gx3_ap#fndtn-specifications)

[Mikrotik Wireless Wire Dish](https://mikrotik.com/product/wireless_wire_dish#fndtn-specifications)


### Installing OpenWRT-M3 on Mikrotik Routers
The compiled OpenWRT Image can be found in [here](https://github.com/kaizheng28/openwrt-m3/files/15083623/openwrt-m3-image.zip).

openwrt-m3-initramfs.bin is the RAM-based image that is used for initial temporary OS installation. 

openwrt-m3-sysupgrade.bin is the flash image that can be used to make the OS permanent.  

A detailed tutorial of installing OpenWRT on the Mikrotik routers can be found in [IMDEA Mikrotik Research Tools](https://github.com/IMDEANetworksWNG/Mikrotik-researcher-tools).

Notably, for Ubuntu 22.04, the tftp server folder is located at /srv/tftp/ . 

### Modification and Re-Compilation
You need the following tools to compile OpenWrt, the package names vary between
distributions. A complete list with distribution specific packages is found in
the [Build System Setup](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-developer/build-system/install-buildsystem)
documentation.

```
binutils bzip2 diff find flex gawk gcc-6+ getopt grep install libc-dev libz-dev
make4.1+ perl python3.7+ rsync subversion unzip which
```

1. Run `./scripts/feeds update -a` to obtain all the latest package definitions
   defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run `./scripts/feeds install -a` to install symlinks for all obtained
   packages into package/feeds/

3. Run `make menuconfig` to select your preferred configuration for the
   toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run `make` to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build the
   cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the GNU/Linux kernel & all chosen
   applications for your target system.
